# quicksort-java-demo
Java based animated demonstration of Quicksort algorithm using HTML5 Canvas, Javascript and AJAX.

I present here an animated demonstration of Quick Sort algorithm running on HTML5 Canvas. Here the Quick Sort algorithm itself is implemented in Java on server side. Javascript is used for display and initialization only. The communication between browser and server is implemented as an AJAX POST request.

The user can choose between the basic version and the version with random pivot choice.

For a Javascript only implementation please visit this repository:
